# 🗺️ Route Finder UI (React + Vite)

## 🔍 **About**
This UI allows users to see all available routes from source location to destination location. For example, for a user who wants to travel from London city center to Besiktas, a route calculation is made and all routes are listed with transportation types.

Users can find their preferred route with intermediate stops such as **airports**, **bus terminals** to go from the starting point to the destination.
Users can also see available routes for chosen date.

You can access detailed info and the backend with this link. [Route Finder](https://github.com/dlrklc/route-api)
